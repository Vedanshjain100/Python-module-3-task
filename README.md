#  Assignment 3 – Functions & Modules in Python

This repository contains two Python programs created for Module 4: Functions & Modules in Python.

The purpose of this assignment is to practice creating and using functions, importing and working with Python modules, taking user input, and performing basic mathematical operations.

#Task 1 – Factorial Using a Function

This program defines a function named factorial() that calculates the factorial of a number using a loop and returns the result.

Example:
If the input is 5, the output will be:
Factorial of 5 is 120

# Task 2 – Math Module Calculations

This program takes a number as input from the user and uses Python’s built-in math module to calculate the square root, natural logarithm (log base e), and sine value (in radians). The calculated results are displayed on the screen.

Example:
If the input is 25, the program displays the square root, logarithm, and sine value.
